Whether you write movies or television — or write about them — it’s often helpful to be able to include short blocks of dialogue and scene description. Unfortunately, most blogging and forum systems make it difficult.

With Scrippets, you can add boxes of nicely-formatted script to your blog. It even works in comments.
